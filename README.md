# Crossy Roads/Frogger Game Board

Game Overview
Objective: Move the frog from the bottom (row 15) to the top (row 0) without hitting a car.

Controls (KEY buttons on DE1-SoC):

KEY0: Right

KEY1: Up

KEY2: Down

KEY3: Left

Win Condition: Reach row 0 without a crash.

Crash Condition: A green (frog) pixel overlaps a red (car) pixel.

Feedback:

VICTOR on HEX displays = win

CRASH on HEX displays = game over

Game resets after a short delay.

Features and Highlights
- Randomized car movement using LFSRs
- Debounced, noise-resistant button inputs
- Real-time crash and victory detection
- HEX display message system with timer
- Modular design for clarity and reusability

üíª How to Run
Open the project in Quartus Prime.

Compile and upload the design to the DE1-SoC board.

Connect a 16x16 LED grid via GPIO_1.

Use the buttons to move the frog.

Watch the LEDs and HEX displays for game feedback.
